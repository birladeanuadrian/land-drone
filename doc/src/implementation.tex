\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:implementation-introduction}
This project contains 4 different components that are deployed in different \
places:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the robot application (deployed and running on the actual robot)
    \item the proxy server that acts as an intermediary between the user \
            controlling the robot and the robot; \
            it runs in a kubernetes \
            cluster in the cloud (GKE, more precisely)
    \item an angular web application that is used to control the robot; \
            it is \
            deployed in the same cloud as the proxy server, but runs in the \
            user's browser
    \item the algorithm used to split an image into several UDP-ready packets \
            and to reconstruct the image from said packets; \
            the algorithm is published as a public package that is imported by \
            both the robot application and the web application
\end{enumerate}

Each component's detailed design and implementation will be detailed below.

%Together with the previous chapter takes about 60\% of the paper.
%
%The purpose of this chapter is to document the developed application such a way that it can be maintained and \
%developed later. \
%A reader should be able (from what you have written here) to identify the main functions of the application.
%
%The chapter should contain (but not limited to):
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item a general application sketch/scheme,
%    \item a description of every component implemented, at module level,
%    \item class diagrams, important classes and methods from key classes.
%\end{itemize}
